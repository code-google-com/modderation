Modderation is a series of comprehensive tutorials about the Source Engine. Source is best known for powering games such as Half Life 2, Portal, and Darwinia. Being used as a basis for Half Life 2, the Source Engine also deeply intertwined with Mods such as Counterstrike and Lost Coast.

At present, the documentation for the Source Engine and the surrounding Half Life 2 code ranges from fragmented to non-existent. Modderation aims to address this lack of documentation by providing a solid reference to the functionality provided by the Source Engine and Half Life 2 mod source.
